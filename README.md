## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a junior Python programmer focused on learning and practicing object-oriented programming (OOP). This repository is a collection of projects, exercises, and notes from my journey toward writing more structured, reusable, and maintainable Python code using OOP principles.

Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that allows developers to model real-world problems using classes and objects. Through this learning process, Iâ€™m gaining a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Iâ€™m also working on building habits around clean code, modular design, and proper use of constructors, methods, and class hierarchies.

This repository includes small Python projects and code snippets that demonstrate how Iâ€™m applying OOP concepts to solve problems. Some examples include simple games, simulations, inventory systems, and text-based applicationsâ€”all written with classes and organized in a way that promotes code reusability and clarity.

In addition to building these projects, Iâ€™m learning how to write docstrings, structure files for better organization, and begin using unit testing to validate object behavior. Iâ€™m also starting to explore best practices such as separating business logic from interface logic and following naming conventions and design patterns.

My goal with this repository is to track my progress, stay consistent in my learning, and hopefully help other beginners who are also getting started with Python and OOP.

If youâ€™re also learning Python or object-oriented design, feel free to check out the code, leave feedback, or share tipsâ€”Iâ€™m always looking to improve and learn from others.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building a strong foundation in Python, one class at a time.
